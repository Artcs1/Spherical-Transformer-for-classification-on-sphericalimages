# Spherical-Transformer-for-classification-on-sphericalimages

## Dependencies

Tangent_images code requires the installation of my Spherical Distortion Package, [which can be found here](https://github.com/meder411/Spherical-Package). Installation instructions are available in the linked repository.

You should be able to test if the installation was successful by running the example scripts in [examples](./examples).
